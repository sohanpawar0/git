Difference between innerText and textContent is innerText keeps the style of the element in consideration,
where textContent does not consider styling of a particular div.

So suppose for this element <h1 style="display:none;">Hello</h1>, if we do const h = document.getElementByTagName('h1') 
and then do console.log(h.innerText), then the result will be void as it considers style, since style="display:none", 
it won't show the result but console.log(h.textContent) will show all the content irrespective of style.
